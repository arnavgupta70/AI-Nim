# AI-Nim

Nim is a gamw where we begin with X number of piles (where X is a Natural Number), each with some number of objects. The player's take turns 
remove any non-negative number of objects from any non-empty pile. The player who removes the last objects loses.

In this project, I have created an AI that begins with no prior knowledge. However, by allowing the AI to play (against itself) and train, 
the AI learns how to play Nim through reinforcement learning.
